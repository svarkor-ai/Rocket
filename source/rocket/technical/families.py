"""Family consensus voting — group indicators into independent families.

Each family (Trend, Momentum, Volume) votes independently.
Within each family, majority rules. Between families, weighted average.

Architecture (evidence-based weighting):
  Momentum (6 indicators) → 50% weight  [Tier 1: Jegadeesh & Titman 1993, Moskowitz et al. 2012]
  Trend (14 indicators)   → 35% weight  [Tier 2: Chan 2007, Aronson 2011]
  Volume (3 indicators)   → 15% weight  [Tier 3: weak evidence for directional prediction]

Each indicator votes: BUY (+1), HOLD (0), SELL (-1)
Family vote: sum of votes / max_possible (normalizes to [-1, 1])
Direction score: weighted sum of family votes → normalized to [0, 1]
